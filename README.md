Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer: Software Engineering refers to the systematic application of engineering principles towards the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Software Engineering is very imoortant in the tech industry because almost all technological systems currently are powered by some sort of software, be it the entertainment industry or the health industry.
Development and maintenance of high quality software systems are absolutely a necessity, as they improve the overall quality of the industries they are used in.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer: The first milestone I can identify is the development of programming languages, as these are the framework upon which software can be engineered.
        Then recognition of software engineering as a discipline, this tells me that at this point it had to have it's own field, meaning the growth of software engineering truly peaked here.
        And lastly the advent of structured programming, and I believe that this is when a sort of generalized algorithm towards how software engineering should go was developed.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Answer: The phases of the SDLC are as follows;
        phase 1:  Requirements; in this phase, the subject matter of the software to be developed is thoroughly looked into. The needs of the intended users, the system requirements as well.
        phase 2:  Design; in this phase, the software solution that must be realized to meet the needs of the intended users is designed. Detailed design of the software architechture and 
                  user interface is done in this phase.
        phase 3:  Implementation; this is the phase where the actual coding/programming of the software, whose requirements and designs were carried out in the prior two stages, is done.
        phase 4:  Testing; the phase where the implemented software goes through series of tests to verify it meets the needs of the user and is bug free, i.e the software is up to standard.
        phase 5:  Deployment; as the name implies, this is the phase where the software is released for interaction with the end users.
        phase 6:  Maintenance; the last phase, where upon feedback or further testing, changes are made to the software to improve the quality and ensure the final product is always up to standard.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Answer: Waterfall methodology and Agile methodology are two development methodologies that can be employed in software development. From my understanding, I believe that both have their pros and cons.
        The Waterfall methodology gives a clear and concise path to reaching the final solution, with each step gearing towards the next, as the name implies, like a waterfall.
        The Agile methodology offers more flexibility, as it is designed to respond to sudden changes as the case may require. The iterative nature of agile methodology ensures that at any point or step it is 
        easy to backtrack and make changes as may be required.
        From this assertion I can say that the Waterfall methodology has the advantage of sustainability and predicability, as we know what must occur in each phase and everyone involved will be geared       
        towards that phase 
        However the Agile methodology is not without its perks too, as it is very reactive and adaptable, unlike the waterfall that is kind of rigid in a sense.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Answer: A Software Developer is responsible for writing the code and implementation of the software system that has been designed.
        A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for ensuring software quality and/or standard by designing and executing numerous tests to test the software.
        A Project Manager is responsible for overseeing the project and organising it; from the planning, to the execution and finally the delivery of the project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Answer: IDEs are important in the software development process, especially to the software engineers as this is essentially the field where they plant their crops. An IDE is an environment where the code 
is written, it can range from a simple text editor to more refined and advanced IDEs like vscode. Without any sort of IDE it would be practically impossible to write the code required to develop a software.
Examples: Vscode, Notepad++

Version Control Systems(VCS) are also important in the software development process. these are systems that enable developers and whoever else may have access to them to track their code and changes made to 
it. They also allow multiple collaborators work on a project at a time, without necessarily overwriting each other's changes. This makes the workflow for software developers easier and faster, and they can 
even serve as a backup as well, in the case there is need to roll back to a previous version of a project.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
